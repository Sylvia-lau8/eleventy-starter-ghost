	<h3>About Me:</h3>
	
	<p>Growing Up I was always interested in drawing and designing. So after I finished high school, I decided to focus my studies on design in creative media. I’m currently a year 1 student at Taylor University, which still have a lot of things to learn about design. The specialization that I have chosen for my year two is Digital Animation. The reason for choosing it was simple, I love watching anime since I was in primary school, I also did watch lots of Disney, Pixar, and Dreamworks movies, which had been a big part of my childhood memory. So, I hope that I was able to have a deeper understanding and learn the skills of creating animation.</p>
	
	<h3>Personal Interest:</h3>
	
	<p>Since I mentioned that I like anime, I enjoy watching it during my free time. Here is a list of some anime series that are my favorites:</p>
	
	<ul>
		
		<li><b><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/53446/Tondemo_Skill_de_Isekai_Hourou_Meshi" target="_blank">Campfire Cooking In Another World with My Absurd Skill</a></b></li>
		
		<p>The story is about a businessman transported to a fantasy world by accident, his only skill turns out to be “Net Super”, which allows him to open an interface where he can purchase food supermarket items from modern Japan. The anime is mainly about cooking, but it has stunning visuals that bring the dishes to life in a way that let my mouth water. It is also very chill and moderately funny to watch which cheers me up when I’m in a down mood.</p>
		
		<li><b><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/38000/Kimetsu_no_Yaiba" target="_blank">Demon Slayer</a></b></li>
		
		<p>The story begins with a family is attacked by demons and only two members survive - Tanjiro and his sister Nezuko, who has turned into a demon. Tanjiro sets out to become a demon slayer to avenge his family and cure his sister. I have seen many action fantasy anime, but this is the best. The character development, emotional moments, and animation are on a whole different level. I went through a number of emotions watching it. The mood keeps varying from time to time, but the tempo never drops, and with intriguing characters, it only gets better and better with every episode.</p>
		
		<li><b><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/918/Gintama" target="_blank">Gintama</a></b></li>
		
		<p>In a world where aliens have invaded Edo Period Japan, skyscrapers, trains, and motorbikes have replaced the simple life of Earth inhabitants. One man, however, still carries the soul of a samurai, Gintoki Sakata, otherwise known as Yorozuya Gin-san. As reckless as he is, Gintoki carries his own resolve and is ready to take on any challenge with his fellow companions. At first, this show was okay for me at the beginning and started improving after episode 30 making me go from light chuckles to laughing out loud. Although Gintama is hilarious in most episodes, when it gets serious, it becomes a different show. It’s still weird to think back on some episodes from the laughter at the beginning which then made me cry at the end. I have to say that Gintama is the best piece of entertainment I’ve ever watched.</p>
